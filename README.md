<h2>About</h2>
<p>This repository will basically contain small projects I have done over a weekend in a maximum of <b>20</b> hours.</p>

<h2>Goals / Inspiration</h2>
<p>
Learning things is university over a semester is fun. Improving your skills and working on a serious project at work is also rewarding.
From doing these two things simultaneously I noticed the lack of developing for the fun of it. Sometimes university can get too theoretical
and at work literally weeks can pass before you see a noticable improvement in the functionality / performance of the project.<br/><br/>
The plan of this project is to step back from all this serious stuff, open a cold beer and start developing something just for the fun of it.
I will practice whatever languages I chose and develop whatever I feel like.
<br/>
My goal is to make arround 10 projects until the end of the year (so something along the lines of one monthly)
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
In order to have enough simularities between the different mini-projects I will define a set of rules which will apply for every mini-project:
<ul>
<li>The are developed for maximum two days, and no more than 20 hours total</li>
<li>If the project is small, it can go as low as two hours of development time</li>
<li>I will pick the platforms and languages before I start developing. Same goes for the idea</li>
<li>Every project will have it's own subfolder with documentation</li>
<li>Any documentation not in the source code can be added at any time after the development stopps</li>
</ul>
</p>i

<h2>Why open source</h2>
<p>
Most projects here are a made with the idea that people can contribute for them. Even though this is a personal project there are two reasons why I want it to be public:<br>
<oul>
<li>Some of the code will most likely be reusable</li>
<li>Mabye some people will hop on the train and start developing</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>List of Projects</h2>
<p>Nothing so far :D<p>
