<h2>General information</h2>
<p>
Something very small, made in arround 20 minutes. It offers a class set, which works with points.
It has the basic set functions - union, intersection, subtraction (difference). 
I wanted to see how fast I can make this work. Since this "project" is very small I will probablly skip 
adding extra documentation.
