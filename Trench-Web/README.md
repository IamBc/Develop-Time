<h3>Tackling painfully common web apps.</h3>

<h3>comp01</h3>
<p>My hello world to mojolicious was making 3 painfully simple apps.
<ul>
<li>
The first one is of the type "How X are you today". The onlny thing which this app has to offer is consistency for the day. Meaning that "Stephen" should always get the same asnwer.
</li>
<li>
The second one is something like "thought of the day" however it is uber trivialized to the point in which it is 2 lines of code.
</li>
<li>
The last one is a genuinely real random number generator. It works, trust me.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<b>Disclaimer</b>The main reason I am uploading this(comp01) is that I am going to make a hello world mojolicious presentation and this is the simplets exapmle I will give.
